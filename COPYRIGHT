		      !!!NOTICE ON COPYRIGHT!!!
				   
Please note that I am now in the process of converting the copyright
license under which Net::Printer is distributed to one that is similar
to the BSD license.  I feel that the BSD license is far more liberal
and not quite as controversial as the LGPL under which previous
versions were released.

Version 0.30 of Net::Printer will be released under a dual-license:
The existing LGPL and the BSD license.  Subsequent versions will then
be released under the BSD version.  This way, if anyone wants to fork
an LGPL branch, they can do so from version 0.30 provided they make
clear which license they're using.

Please see the files COPYRIGHT.GNU and COPYRIGHT.BSD for the relevant
terms and conditions for distribution.
