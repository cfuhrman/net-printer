        Windows-friendly and has a better reputation for safety.

      * Re-write of test program
        
         - Add the following environmental variables for influencing test
           behavior:
        
            + LPD_SERVER  : [default:localhost] Server to test against
            + LPD_PRINTER : [default:lp] Printer on server to test against
            + LPD_PORT    : [default:515] Port to talk to on server
        
         - Make sure there is a valid lpd process running on the given port
           before beginning tests
         - Switch to using Test::More

        Under Strawberry Perl, the POSIX::tmpnam() function does not return a
        valid Windows-compatible temporary file name, so roll our own should
        we detect MSWin32.
