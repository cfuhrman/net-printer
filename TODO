---------------------------

* Have Net::Printer accept multiple files without having to create a
  new printer object.

* Allow programers to send Net::Printer multiple strings and then have
  it print out all in one go via some sort of printit method.

* Write DESTROY method to disconnect cleanly.  Calls a close method?

* Figure out why sprintf is causing perl -w to complain.
