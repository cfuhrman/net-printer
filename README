Net::Printer - Perl extension for direct-to-lpd printing.

Last Modified: $Date: 2003/02/12 14:41:59 $

Perl module for directly printing to a print server/printer without
having to create a pipe to either lpr or lp.  This essentially mimics
what the BSD LPR program does by connecting directly to the line
printer printer port (almost always 515), and transmitting the data
and control information to the print server.

Please note that this module only communicates with the BSD Line
Printer Daemon Protocol as described in RFC-1179
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1179.txt).  It does not natively speak to
remote print servers via SMB, Apple-Talk or Netware.  Remote print
services running lpsched, such as Sun Solaris or other Sys V-derived
operating systems, will work so long as the print spoolers are set up
to understand the BSD protocol.  Most modern network-capable laser
printers, such as those manufactured by HP and LexMark, also "speak"
BSD.

This module replaces my older LinePrinter module which should be
considered obsolete and potentially full of security holes (not to
mention my horrid programming ;)

Installation:

1) perl Makefile.PL
2) make
3) [optional] su
4) [optional] perl test.pl
5) make install

More information can be found via perldoc.

Systems:

This module has been tested under the following systems:

* Linux
* Sun Solaris 5.6 SPARC (Jochen Stenzel)
* Sun Solaris 2.7 x86
* UnixWARE 2.1.3
* Cygwin 1.1 Win32 (Neil Lunn)
* OpenBSD 3.2

It should run successfully on other systems.  Feel free to notify me
if this module works successfully under other OSes.
