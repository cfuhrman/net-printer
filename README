Net::Printer - Perl extension for direct-to-lpd printing.

Last Modified: $Date: 2000/06/06 21:10:51 $

Perl module for directly printing to a print server/printer without
having to create a pipe to either lpr or lp.  This essentially mimics
what the BSD LPR program does by connecting directly to the line
printer printer port (almost always 515), and transmitting the data
and control information to the print server.

Please note that this module only talks to print servers that speak
BSD.  It will not talk to printers using SMB or SysV unless they are
set up as BSD printers.

This module replaces my older LinePrinter module.

Installation:

1) perl Makefile.PL
2) make
3) [optional] su
4) make install

More information can be found via perldoc.

Systems:

This module has been tested under the following systems:

* Linux
* Sun Solaris 2.7 x86
* UnixWARE 2.1.3

It should run successfully on other systems.  Feel free to notify me
if this module works successfully under other OSes.
